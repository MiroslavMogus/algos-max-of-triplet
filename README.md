# Maximum product of a triplet (subsequnece of size 3) in array

A non-empty array arr consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to arr[P] * arr[Q] * arr[R] (0 â‰¤ P < Q < R < N). [![Awesome Badges](https://img.shields.io/badge/badges-awesome-green.svg)](https://github.com/Naereen/badges)

For example, array arr such that:

  * arr[0] = -20
  * arr[1] =  5
  * arr[2] = -8
  * arr[3] = 10
  * arr[4] = 15

 find the maximal product of any triplet.
